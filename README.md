# Jupyter Scripts

The Useful JupyterScripts for Python Demo Codes.
The Scripts are supposed to be independent.

# Tips

The jupyter script can be **TOO LARGE** if you **OUTPUT** some large data on the display cell.
So, it is the user's responsibility to keep the size of the file small and efficiency.

In practice, user can always use the **"Kernel -> Restart & Clear Output"** command to disable all the output,
which will dramatically decrease the size of the script, but all the output will be discarded.
It means the user may have to operate the script if they want to see the results.
In a word, there is a trade-off between size and efficiency.
